RECEIPT CALCULATOR 2.0, 10.03.2023
Takes in a valid Star Market receipt, and splits it between to users (Michael and Jackson, though is open to more users IF AND ONLY IF the directory of the spreadsheet
provided follows the same format) depending on if the items are to be shared or paid for individually.
It also updates the Shared Costs spreadsheet.

BEFORE RUNNING:
Run the "inits.bat" file at least once in order to install all required packages for the script.

In order to run the file itself, the "receiptcalcGUI_2.app" file is the main that needs to be ran.
This file calls the "receiptcalcGUI_2.bat" file to run without a console, which calls the "receiptcalcGUI_2.py" file to run the script.

NOTE AS OF 09.27.2023:
The specific sheet in the Google Sheets document is currently set to sheet 2 - if this were to change in the future, it would need to be modified inside of the script.
